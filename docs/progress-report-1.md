# Progress Report - ABT-v1 Booster Game Development

## Project Overview
This report documents the major issues encountered and solutions implemented during the development of the ABT-v1 Booster Card Battle game, particularly focusing on the battle system and real-time multiplayer functionality.

## Summary of Issues Resolved

### 1. ESLint Deployment Issue
**Problem:** Vercel deployment failing due to ESLint warnings in battle page
- `fetchCardDetails` function changing dependencies on every render
- Missing dependencies in useEffect Hook

**Solution:** 
- Wrapped `fetchCardDetails` in `useCallback` with proper `[supabase]` dependency
- Added missing dependencies `fetchCardDetails` and `fetchBattleData` to useEffect
- Build now succeeds without warnings

**Files Modified:**
- `./src/app/game/arena/battle/[battleId]/page.tsx`

### 2. Arena Page Removal - UX Improvement
**Problem:** Unnecessary navigation step - users had to visit `/game/arena` before accessing lobby
- Arena page served as redundant intermediate step
- Poor user experience with extra clicks

**Solution:**
- Removed `/game/arena/page.tsx` entirely
- Updated all navigation references to point directly to `/game/arena/lobby`
- Streamlined user flow for better UX

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/useBattle.ts`
- `src/components/navigation/HamburgerMenu.tsx`
- `src/app/page.tsx`
- `src/app/battle/page.tsx`
- `src/app/game/arena/battle/[battleId]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/admin/setup/page.tsx`

### 3. Lobby Real-time Updates Fix
**Problem:** Players would appear briefly in lobby then disappear
- Race condition between database queries and presence system
- Conflicting data sources causing inconsistent UI state

**Solution:**
- Implemented exclusive use of Supabase Presence system
- Removed conflicting database queries
- Added manual refresh button as fallback
- Enhanced with connection status indicators
- Improved error handling and logging

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/game/lobby/OnlinePlayersList.tsx`

### 4. Battle Arena Real-time Updates Enhancement
**Problem:** Players stuck in "waiting for opponent" loop after both submitted cards
- Insufficient real-time communication between players
- Missing battle state synchronization

**Solution:**
- Applied multi-layered real-time approach:
  - Presence-based channels for player status
  - Broadcast channels for immediate updates
  - 3-second polling backup during active phases
  - Database subscriptions as final fallback
- Enhanced `CardSelectionGrid` to broadcast card submission events
- Implemented comprehensive battle state tracking

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/game/arena/battle/[battleId]/page.tsx`
- `src/components/game/battle/CardSelectionGrid.tsx`

### 5. Database Query Errors Fix
**Problem:** Multiple critical database errors affecting battle functionality
- 404 errors: `GET cards?select=*&id=eq.undefined`
- 406 errors: `GET player_cards?select=*&id=eq.xxx`
- Battle skipping "cards_revealed" phase
- Manual refresh required for final results

**Root Cause:** Code written for normalized database structure but actual database stores all card data in `player_cards` table

**Solution:**
- Removed joins to non-existent `cards` table
- Modified `fetchCardDetails` to query directly from `player_cards` table
- Fixed field name mapping (card_name vs name, card_type vs type)
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Improved data validation

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/game/arena/battle/[battleId]/page.tsx`

## Technical Architecture Improvements

### Real-time Communication Stack
1. **Primary:** Supabase Presence System
2. **Secondary:** Broadcast Channels
3. **Backup:** Polling (3-second intervals)
4. **Fallback:** Database Subscriptions

### Database Query Optimization
- Eliminated unnecessary table joins
- Simplified queries to match actual schema
- Added proper error handling for undefined values
- Implemented field mapping for schema consistency

### Code Quality Enhancements
- Fixed ESLint warnings for deployment
- Improved useCallback/useEffect dependency management
- Enhanced error handling throughout battle system
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

## Current Status

### ✅ Resolved Issues
- ESLint deployment warnings
- Unnecessary navigation steps
- Lobby player disappearing
- Battle real-time communication
- Database query errors

### ⚠️ Remaining Issues
- Battle skipping "cards_revealed" phase (going directly to "completed")
- Manual refresh still required for final results
- Battle resolution happening too fast
- Edge Function or database trigger resolving battles immediately

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Battle Phase Management:** Investigate why "cards_revealed" phase is being skipped
2. **Auto-refresh Fix:** Implement proper battle completion detection
3. **Battle Resolution Timing:** Add delay or confirmation step before auto-resolution

### Medium Priority
1. **Performance Optimization:** Review and optimize real-time update frequency
2. **Error Handling:** Add more comprehensive error boundaries
3. **User Experience:** Add loading states and better feedback

### Low Priority
1. **Code Documentation:** Add JSDoc comments to battle system functions
2. **Testing:** Implement unit tests for battle logic
3. **Monitoring:** Add analytics for battle system performance

## Key Learnings

1. **Real-time Systems:** Multiple fallback layers are essential for reliable multiplayer functionality
2. **Database Design:** Code should match actual database schema, not idealized normalized structure
3. **User Experience:** Remove unnecessary navigation steps to improve user flow
4. **Debugging:** Comprehensive logging is crucial for diagnosing real-time issues
5. **Development Process:** Breaking large tasks into manageable pieces improves success rate

## Memory Context
- **Supabase Project ID:** bcruruditvacntcpzvsh
- **Previous Battle Arena Fix:** Resolved "loading battle..." issue with database triggers and SERVICE_ROLE_KEY problems
- **Battle Resolution Logic:** Fixed card comparison bug (card_name vs card_type)
- **PGRST204 Error:** Fixed by removing non-existent 'explanation' column reference
