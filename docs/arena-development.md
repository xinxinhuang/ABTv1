# Arena Development Summary

## Current Implementation (as of July 10, 2025)

### Overview

We've implemented an online battle system for the ABT Booster Game that allows players to challenge each other remotely in real-time PvP matches. The battle system follows a rock-paper-scissors style combat mechanic with card type advantages and attribute-based resolution, while leveraging Supabase for player authentication and real-time battle synchronization.

## Implementation Details

### Card Ownership & Staking System

The battle system includes a high-stakes card transfer mechanic:
1. All cards are permanently branded with their original owner's ID
2. When entering a battle, players stake their selected card
3. The winner claims the loser's card, which is transferred to their inventory
4. Transferred cards maintain their original owner's branding
5. Players can view a card's ownership history
6. Optional practice mode allows battles without card staking

### Online Battle System

The online battle system uses Supabase for authentication and real-time capabilities:
1. Players connect to the battle lobby and see online opponents
2. Challenge requests can be sent to online players, indicating stake/no-stake mode
3. When accepted, a dedicated battle instance is created
4. Both players select cards from their own inventories
5. Battle state is synchronized in real-time via Supabase channels
6. Card ownership transfer is processed automatically after battle completion

### Battle Logic

The battle logic follows these steps:
1. Compare card types for inherent type advantages
2. If same type, compare primary attribute values
3. If still tied, declare a draw

```typescript
// Type advantage system: Void Sorcerer > Space Marine > Galactic Ranger > Void Sorcerer
if (card1.card_name === 'Void Sorcerer' && card2.card_name === 'Space Marine') {
  return { winner: 'player1', message: 'Void Sorcerer\'s mystical powers overwhelm Space Marine!' };
} else if (card1.card_name === 'Space Marine' && card2.card_name === 'Galactic Ranger') {
  return { winner: 'player1', message: 'Space Marine\'s brute strength overcomes Galactic Ranger!' };
} else if (card1.card_name === 'Galactic Ranger' && card2.card_name === 'Void Sorcerer') {
  return { winner: 'player1', message: 'Galactic Ranger\'s speed outwits Void Sorcerer!' };
}
// ... similar logic for player2 winning scenarios
```

### User Flow

1. Player navigates to the Battle Arena Lobby
2. Player sees a list of online opponents
3. Player selects an opponent and sends a challenge (choosing stake or no-stake mode)
4. When accepted, both players are redirected to a battle instance
5. Each player selects a card from their own inventory (with clear indication of staking)
6. System synchronizes selections and displays "Ready" status
7. Battle begins with animation and countdown
8. System determines and displays the winner with explanation
9. Winner receives loser's card (if staked mode was selected)
10. Card ownership transfer animation is displayed
11. Players can request a rematch or return to lobby

## Current Implementation

### Database Schema

The online battle system uses the following Supabase tables:

```sql
-- Online player tracking
create table public.online_players (
  id uuid references auth.users not null primary key,
  last_seen timestamp with time zone default now(),
  status text default 'online' check (status in ('online', 'in_battle', 'away'))
);

-- Battle instances
create table public.battle_instances (
  id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
  player1_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  player2_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  status text default 'pending' check (status in ('pending', 'active', 'completed')),
  winner_id uuid references auth.users,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
  completed_at timestamp with time zone
);

-- Battle card selections
create table public.battle_cards (
  battle_id uuid references public.battle_instances not null,
  player_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  card_id uuid references public.player_cards not null,
  is_staked boolean default true,
  selected_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
  primary key (battle_id, player_id)
);

-- Card ownership history
create table public.card_ownership_history (
  id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
  card_id uuid references public.player_cards not null,
  previous_owner_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  new_owner_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  battle_id uuid references public.battle_instances not null,
  transferred_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);
```

### Real-time Communication

The system uses Supabase's real-time channels for:

- Player online status updates
- Battle challenge requests and responses
- Card selection synchronization
- Battle state broadcasting
- Chat messages during battles
- Card ownership transfer notifications

## Technical Architecture & Considerations

### Supabase Real-time Strengths

1. **WebSocket-based Channels**
   - Supabase uses WebSockets under the hood, providing low latency communication
   - Perfect for real-time battle synchronization and turn-based combat
   - Enables instant updates for card selections and battle state changes

2. **Built-in Presence Tracking**
   - The `online_players` table with last_seen timestamps leverages Supabase's presence tracking
   - Simplifies online player discovery without building custom presence systems
   - Automatically handles player status updates (online, in-battle, away)

3. **Atomic Transactions**
   - Card ownership transfers require bulletproof data integrity
   - Supabase's PostgreSQL backend provides ACID compliance for critical operations
   - Ensures cards are never duplicated or lost during transfers between players

4. **Row-level Security**
   - Battle data is secured so players can only see appropriate information
   - Prevents cheating by restricting access to opponent's card selection until revealed
   - Enables secure spectator mode with limited data visibility

### Implementation Example

```typescript
// Connection state management for battle instances
const [connectionState, setConnectionState] = useState<'connected' | 'reconnecting' | 'disconnected'>('connected');

// Handle battle channel subscription with reconnection handling
const battleChannel = supabase.channel(`battle:${battleId}`)
  .on('postgres_changes', 
      { event: 'UPDATE', schema: 'public', table: 'battle_instances', filter: `id=eq.${battleId}` },
      handleBattleStateChange
  )
  .on('postgres_changes',
      { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'battle_cards' },
      handleCardSelection
  )
  .on('system', { event: 'error' }, () => {
    setConnectionState('disconnected');
    showReconnectionUI();
  })
  .on('system', { event: 'reconnect' }, () => {
    setConnectionState('reconnecting');
    showReconnectingIndicator();
  })
  .on('system', { event: 'connected' }, () => {
    setConnectionState('connected');
    hideConnectionIndicators();
  })
  .subscribe();

// Cleanup on component unmount
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    battleChannel.unsubscribe();
  };
}, []);
```

### Technical Challenges & Optimizations

1. **Connection Handling**
   - Supabase real-time can have hiccups with reconnection logic
   - Implementing robust error handling for when players lose connection mid-battle
   - Providing clear UI feedback during connection state changes
   - Ability to resume battles from last known state after reconnection

2. **Scaling Limits**
   - Supabase has connection limits (up to 200 concurrent real-time connections on paid plans)
   - Implementing connection pooling for high-traffic periods
   - Potential sharding strategy for battle data as player base grows
   - Monitoring connection usage and implementing graceful degradation

3. **Card Balance**
   - The rock-paper-scissors system needs further balance testing
   - Higher rarity cards may create balance issues
   - Analytics-driven balance adjustments
   - Monitoring card win rates and ownership transfers

### Conflict Resolution Strategies

#### The Core Problem

In real-time battles, network latency creates timing conflicts. When two players make actions "simultaneously," the server might receive them in different orders, or one player might see outdated game state. This is especially critical in our card staking system where valuable cards can change ownership.

#### 1. Card Selection Race Conditions

```typescript
// BAD: Both players select cards at same time
// Player A selects card, UI shows "waiting for opponent"
// Player B selects card, but sees Player A as "not ready"
// Result: Confusing state where both think they're waiting

// GOOD: Optimistic updates with rollback
const selectCard = async (cardId: string) => {
  // Optimistic update - show immediately
  setSelectedCard(cardId);
  setStatus('ready');
  
  try {
    const { error } = await supabase
      .from('battle_cards')
      .insert({ battle_id, player_id, card_id: cardId });
    
    if (error) {
      // Rollback on conflict
      setSelectedCard(null);
      setStatus('selecting');
      showError('Card already selected by opponent');
    }
  } catch (err) {
    // Network error rollback
    setSelectedCard(null);
    setStatus('selecting');
  }
};
```

#### 2. Battle State Synchronization

```typescript
// BAD: Trust client state
// Player A sees "I won!" 
// Player B sees "I won!"
// Both clients calculated different results

// GOOD: Server-authoritative with optimistic prediction
const handleBattleResult = (localResult: BattleResult) => {
  // Show optimistic result immediately
  setLocalResult(localResult);
  setShowingResult(true);
  
  // But wait for server confirmation
  const channel = supabase.channel(`battle-${battleId}`)
    .on('postgres_changes', 
      { event: 'UPDATE', schema: 'public', table: 'battle_instances' },
      (payload) => {
        const serverResult = payload.new.result;
        if (serverResult !== localResult) {
          // Server overrides client prediction
          setLocalResult(serverResult);
          showNotification('Battle result updated by server');
        }
      }
    ).subscribe();
};
```

#### 3. Card Ownership Transfer Conflicts

This is critical since cards have real value:

```typescript
// DANGEROUS: Race condition in card transfer
// What if both players think they won?
// What if network fails mid-transfer?
// What if the same card gets transferred twice?

// SAFER: Atomic transaction with conflict detection
const transferCard = async (winnerId: string, loserId: string, cardId: string) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('transfer_card_atomic', {
    battle_id: battleId,
    winner_id: winnerId,
    loser_id: loserId,
    card_id: cardId
  });
  
  if (error?.code === 'CONFLICT') {
    // Handle duplicate transfer attempt
    await syncBattleState();
    return;
  }
};
```

#### 4. Connection Drop During Critical Moments

```typescript
// Player disconnects right as they're about to lose
// System needs to handle this gracefully

const handleDisconnection = () => {
  // Set battle to "paused" state
  // Give player 30 seconds to reconnect
  // If no reconnection, award victory to connected player
  // Still process card transfer
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (!playerReconnected) {
      completeBattleByDefault(connectedPlayerId);
    }
  }, 30000);
};
```

#### 5. Battle State Machine

```typescript
type BattleState = 'waiting' | 'selecting' | 'ready' | 'battling' | 'completed';

const validateStateTransition = (from: BattleState, to: BattleState) => {
  const validTransitions = {
    'waiting': ['selecting'],
    'selecting': ['ready', 'waiting'],
    'ready': ['battling', 'selecting'],
    'battling': ['completed'],
    'completed': []
  };
  
  return validTransitions[from]?.includes(to) || false;
};
```

#### 6. Atomic Card Transfer Database Function

```sql
-- PostgreSQL function for atomic card transfer
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION transfer_card_atomic(
  battle_id UUID,
  winner_id UUID,
  loser_id UUID,
  card_id UUID
) RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Check if battle is actually completed and winner is correct
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM battle_instances 
    WHERE id = battle_id AND winner_id = winner_id AND status = 'completed'
  ) THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Invalid battle state for transfer';
  END IF;
  
  -- Atomic transfer with ownership history
  UPDATE player_cards SET owner_id = winner_id WHERE id = card_id;
  INSERT INTO card_ownership_history (...) VALUES (...);
  
  -- Mark transfer as completed
  UPDATE battle_instances SET transfer_completed = true WHERE id = battle_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### 7. Client-Side Reconciliation

```typescript
// Periodically sync with server state
const reconcileBattleState = async () => {
  const { data: serverState } = await supabase
    .from('battle_instances')
    .select('*')
    .eq('id', battleId)
    .single();
    
  if (serverState.status !== localBattleState.status) {
    // Server state differs from local - server wins
    setLocalBattleState(serverState);
    showNotification('Battle state synchronized with server');
  }
};
```

#### Key Implementation Principles

For our high-stakes battle system with card ownership transfers, we follow these critical principles:

1. **Server-authoritative battle results** - Never trust client calculations
2. **Atomic database transactions** - Card transfers must be bulletproof
3. **Optimistic UI updates** - Show immediate feedback, but allow server corrections
4. **Graceful rollback** - When conflicts happen, reset gracefully
5. **Connection state management** - Handle disconnections fairly

## Conclusion

The online arena system transforms the ABT Booster Game into a high-stakes competitive multiplayer experience. The card staking mechanic where winners take losers' cards adds significant risk and reward to each battle, while the permanent branding of cards with their original owner's ID creates a unique collection meta-game and ownership history. This system successfully leverages Supabase's real-time capabilities to create seamless player-versus-player battles while maintaining a dynamic card economy. The integration with the existing unlimited card pack mechanics provides players with a complete progression loop from opening packs to battling online opponents with real consequences. Future development will focus on refining the matchmaking system, expanding competitive features, and creating a thriving battle community driven by the high-stakes card economy.
